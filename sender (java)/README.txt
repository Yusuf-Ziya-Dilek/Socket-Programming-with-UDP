1) If you give Dmax, loss rate and timeout too high and Windows Size(N) too low, it may take considerable amount of time
to finish the transmission since the image file that given to us is in 4K resolution.

2) You can use comman line argument "javac JavaSender.java" to compile the code

3) You can run the compiled file with this format "java JavaSender <file_path> <receiver_port> <window_size_N> <retransmission_timeout>"
